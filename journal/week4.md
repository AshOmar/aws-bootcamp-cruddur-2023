# Week 4 â€” Postgres and RDS

## Create RDS Postgres Instance
Used below AWS CLI command to create RDS Postgres Instance:

aws rds create-db-instance \
  --db-instance-identifier cruddur-db-instance \
  --db-instance-class db.t3.micro \
  --engine postgres \
  --engine-version  14.6 \
  --master-username cruddurroot \
  --master-user-password ******* \
  --allocated-storage 20 \
  --availability-zone ca-central-1a \
  --backup-retention-period 0 \
  --port 5432 \
  --no-multi-az \
  --db-name cruddur \
  --storage-type gp2 \
  --publicly-accessible \
  --storage-encrypted \
  --enable-performance-insights \
  --performance-insights-retention-period 7 \
  --no-deletion-protection

## Bash scripting for common database actions
created many Bash scripts for different db actions and modified the db-drop script to skip failure and consider success if DB does not exist.

## Connect Gitpod to RDS instance
We have to add Gitpod IP to RDS security group rule every time we initiate a new environment so below steps should be considered:
1- Modify gitpod.yml file to get Gitpod IP
2- Call bash script to modify AWS ec2 security group rule to allow connetions from Gitpod IP
