# Week 1 â€” App Containerization

## Required Homework

### Containarize Backend
#### Run Python

Thought that python is already installed so I can run flask directly but I got below error saying that no module named flask.

flask should be installed first then I can use run command so I used pip install command to install libraries from requirements.txt which contains flask and flask-cors

got error 404 because of end point
