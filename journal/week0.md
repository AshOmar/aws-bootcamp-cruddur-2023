### Recreate Conceptual Diagram in Lucid Charts or on a Napkin

Started to create my conceptual diagram using Lucidchart but unfortunatelly got "Out of Free Shapes" message as shown under [`Lucid Challenge Section`](#lucid-challenge). 

Below you can find my **"Not Completed"** conceptual diagram using Lucidchart: 

**Note:** below image has a link to my Lucidchart Conceptual Diagram.

I've decided to complete the conceptual design using my IPAD as a Napkin as below:

### Recreate Logical Architectural Diagram in Lucid Charts

I've completed my logical architectural diagram using Lucidcharts because I've started this befor the conceptual one just to practice Lucidchart although I know that we should start always with the conceptual one then the logical.

Below is an image of my logical diagram with a link to my Lucidchart:
